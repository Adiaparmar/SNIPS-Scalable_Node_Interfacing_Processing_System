## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Network Topology

SNIPS implements a **star-of-stars topology** with role-based specialization:

```
        [A1] ---- [A2] ---- [A3]     (Anchor Nodes - Positioning Infrastructure)
         |         |         |
         |        [R1]       |        (Relay Node - Communication Coordinator)
         |       /    \      |
        [M1] ------------ [M2]        (Mobile Nodes - End User Devices)
```

### Design Rationale

#### **Why Star-of-Stars?**

1. **Positioning Requirements**: Fixed anchor nodes provide stable reference points
2. **Power Efficiency**: Mobile nodes can sleep between scheduled communications
3. **Scalability**: Hierarchical structure supports network growth
4. **Reliability**: Multiple paths available for critical communications

## 📡 Protocol Stack Integration

### Unified Architecture Philosophy

> _"Positioning is not an add-on, but a native protocol function"_

Traditional approaches treat positioning as a separate service. SNIPS integrates positioning measurements directly into the communication protocol's TDMA structure.

### Layer Integration

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│        Application Layer            │ ← User data + position API
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Network Layer               │ ← Positioning-aware routing
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│          MAC Layer                  │ ← TDMA + positioning slots
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│        Physical Layer               │ ← LoRa modulation
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Integration Points**:

- **MAC Layer**: TDOA measurements scheduled within TDMA control phase
- **Network Layer**: Route costs include geographical distance metrics
- **Application Layer**: Unified API provides both communication and positioning

## 🔄 Hybrid Protocol Approach

### TDMA + Store-and-Forward Combination

#### **Structured TDMA (Primary)**

- **Predictable Access**: Guaranteed time slots for critical communications
- **Collision-Free**: Deterministic medium access for positioning accuracy
- **Power Efficient**: Nodes can sleep when not in assigned slots

#### **Opportunistic Store-and-Forward (Fallback)**

- **Resilience**: Alternative paths when TDMA slots unavailable
- **Flexibility**: Handles unexpected traffic and network changes
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic route discovery for failed nodes

### Protocol Decision Logic

```
Incoming Packet → Is TDMA slot available?
                     ↓ Yes              ↓ No
                TDMA transmission    Store-and-forward
                     ↓                    ↓
                Direct delivery     Opportunistic relay
```

## 📍 Positioning Integration

### TDOA-Based Trilateration

#### **Measurement Process**

1. **Anchor Coordination**: A1 initiates positioning sequence
2. **Mobile Transmission**: Target mobile (M1) transmits positioning beacon
3. **Time Measurement**: All anchors record arrival timestamps
4. **TDOA Calculation**: Time differences computed relative to A1
5. **Position Calculation**: Trilateration algorithm determines coordinates

#### **Timing Requirements**

- **Synchronization Accuracy**: ±10μs between anchors
- **Measurement Resolution**: 1μs (≈300m distance resolution)
- **Positioning Rate**: Every 5-10 seconds per mobile node
- **Accuracy Target**: <5m in outdoor line-of-sight conditions

### Integration Benefits

**Compared to Separate Systems**:

- ✅ **No Protocol Interference**: Positioning uses dedicated time slots
- ✅ **Shared Infrastructure**: Same nodes handle communication and positioning
- ✅ **Unified Power Management**: Coordinated sleep/wake cycles
- ✅ **Positioning-Aware Routing**: Geography influences route selection
